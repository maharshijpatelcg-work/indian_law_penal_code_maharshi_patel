## 📖 Comprehensive Overview

The **Indian Penal & Legal Framework API** is a robust, scalable, and highly detailed RESTful backend service built for legal technology platforms, researchers, and law students. It acts as a centralized repository and data provider for the Indian Penal Code (IPC), various legal acts, sections, courts, and offenses. 

The primary goal of this system is to transform raw legal datasets into highly structured, searchable, and filterable endpoints, enabling frontend applications to easily display legal records, analyze crime categories, and track updates to laws.

## ✨ Core System Features

### 🔍 Advanced Search & Querying
- Fast keyword-based search across legal titles, descriptions, and categories.
- Combine search with multiple filters (e.g., search for "fraud" in the state of "Maharashtra").

### 📊 Dynamic Filtering & Sorting
- Filter records by Acts, Chapters, Sections, States, Courts, and Offense Categories.
- Sort laws dynamically by views, popularity, creation date, or section numbers.

### 🛡️ Robust Authentication & Security
- Secure, token-based authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
- Secure route protection, OTP flows, and role-based access control (Admin vs. User).
- Protection against API abuse with **Rate Limiting** middleware.

### 📈 Data Aggregation & Analytics
- Deep dive analytics tracking the most viewed, bookmarked, and trending laws.
- Court and state-level statistical breakdowns powered by **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines**.

### 🧩 Industry Standard Architecture
- Built on a strict **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern.
- Clean separation of concerns with isolated routes, controllers, and services.

## 📂 Project Architecture & Structure

The repository follows a clean monolithic MVC structure. All backend logic resides inside the `/backend` folder to keep the codebase highly organized.
